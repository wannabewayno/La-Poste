# TimeSheet
A rough Estimate for man hours put into this project

## Thursday 27th August
### 4:00pm start
* so far, a react app, deployed on heroku <a href="https://la-poste.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, with basic api routing built, controllers built and react router displaying a simple 'this is a dashboard" or "this is a signin page"
### 5:03pm stop for coffee break (1hr)

### 6:10pm back from break
* made small adjustments whilst on the phone regards to import statements for react router.
* found background images from unsplash to use with background router
* troubleshoot react-router causing server error on heroku (missing require statement in routes)
* trouble shooting an import error with my own npm package :D. Fixed, now I can use all       custom built react components from this library through the rest of the build
### 7:41pm stop for a run and dinner (1hr 1/2)

### 9:22pm back from break
* create basic SignIn Form
* create basic SignUp Form
### 10:07pm stop for tea break

### 10:16pm back from break
* created a turntable component, flips the sign-in and sign-up forms via a small button underneath the main (sign-up or create account buttons), was a bit fiddly, burned a bit of time but I had fun doing it.
* adjusted CSS slightly so for mobile friendly design and without the form being too big for desktop.
* signin page almost complete, the forms needs hooking up to the routes, and a better colour scheme, colour has not be chosen at this stage
